              "\"?\\n\\nEndometriosis is a common condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the womb (endometrium) is found outside the womb.\\n\\nThe endometrium thickens and bleeds during each menstrual cycle. If endometrial tissue is found outside the womb, it can also thicken, break down and bleed. This can cause pain, inflammation and the formation of scar tissue (adhesions).\\n\\nEndometriosis can affect any reproductive organ, including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, bowel and the lining of the pelvis. It can also grow on the surface of the peritoneum, which is the thin layer of tissue that lines the abdominal cavity and covers most of the organs in the belly.\\n\\nEndometriosis can affect women of all ages and backgrounds, but it's most commonly diagnosed in women of reproductive age.\\n\\nSymptoms of endometriosis\\n\\nThe main symptoms of endometriosis are:\\n\\n- pain in your lower tummy or back (period pain)\\n- pain during or after sex\\n- pain when peeing or pooing during your period\\n- feeling sick, constipated, or bloated during your period\\n- difficulty getting pregnant\\n\\nIn some cases, there may be no symptoms at all, or they can be so mild that they're not noticed.\\n\\nThe symptoms can vary from woman to woman, and can also change over time.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so they don't necessarily mean you have endometriosis.\\n\\nWhen to see a GP\\n\\nSee a GP if you have symptoms of endometriosis that are affecting your quality of life.\\n\\nThe GP will ask about your symptoms and may ask questions about your periods and sex life. They'll also carry out a physical examination, including an internal examination (vaginal speculum and gloved finger).\\n\\nYou may be referred to a gynaecologist for further tests if endometriosis is suspected.\\n\\nCauses of endometriosis\\n\\nThe exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but a number of theories have been suggested, including:\\n\\n- Retrograde menstruation – where blood containing endometrial cells flows back through\""
